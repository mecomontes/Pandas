# Master Data Analysis with Python
===========================================

This document contains information on how to get the most out of Master Data Analysis with
Python.

Master Data Analysis with Python represents over 1,000 hours of work reading, writing, coding,
and teaching. I have worked extremely hard to put together a comprehensive text that teaches
the Python data science ecosystem as best as humanely possible. Please only use the contents of
these ﬁles if you have paid for their use from the Dunder Data book store.

## File Contents
Master Data Analysis with Python contains 10 'parts'. Each part contains Jupyter Notebooks with all
the text and code. Each notebook is considered a chapter. The code within the notebooks is NOT
executed. As you go through the material in the notebooks, you will need to execute each line of
code. There are exercises at the end of each chapter with the solutions found in the Solutions
notebooks.

## Installing Python and Setting up your Environment
A major hurdle to getting started with data analysis in Python is installing the software correctly on
your system. Once installed, it is crucial to set up an environment that you can depend on to do
data analysis. Open the Installing Python and Setting up an Environment for Data Science
document for a complete tutorial on how to set up a dependable and reliable environment for
doing data science with Python.

## Continual Updates
Master Data Analysis with Python will have major updates throughout 2019. The ﬁnal draft of the
book will have around 12 parts, 1,000 pages, 500 exercises, and multiple projects. Updates and
errata ﬁxes will be provided until the end of 2020.

---
## Hard Copy
A printed, hard copy of the book will be available on Amazon and other major book stores by the
end of 2019.

---
## Getting Started
I suggest covering the material by using the Jupyter Notebook program on your computer. This
allows you to read the text, experiment with code, and complete the exercises all in one place.
PDF of all Material

There is a PDF ﬁle in the 'Book' directory containing all of the material in a single document which
makes it easier to search for speciﬁc topics. Note, there will be some material only available as
Jupyter Notebooks.
